One major issue plaguing the hospitality sector is the high rate of cancellation rates. These are often due to unexpected circumstances such as health issues, accidents, adverse weather, conflicts in schedules, or unforeseen duties (Falk and Vieru, 2018). Interestingly, a significant portion of these cancellations comes from customers who continue to search for better deals after booking, sometimes holding multiple reservations to choose the most favorable option (Antonio et al., 2017).

In response, the hospitality industry has adapted by modifying hotel cancellation policies, which are vital for managing various business outcomes, including optimizing revenue and profit. Prior to the pandemic, there was a notable trend towards stricter cancellation policies, such as reducing the period during which cancellations are free or increasing the fees for cancellations (Riasi et al., 2019; Smith et al., 2015).

Additionally, the application of machine learning to predict and mitigate potential cancellations is becoming increasingly prominent. A variety of systems, utilizing booking data and employing algorithms from support vector machines and artificial neural networks to tree-based models, support hotel management (Andriawan et al., 2020; Sánchez-Medina and C-Sánchez, 2020). Although many of these initiatives are theoretical, some practical applications have shown a reduction in cancellations by as much as 37 percentage points (Antonio et al., 2019a).

However, much of the literature overlooks the significance of the variables used in these models and fails to elucidate the rationale behind the predictions. Exploring these models thoroughly is crucial in developing effective hotel management support systems. It's important for the development process to include business validation and ethical assessment, especially since stringent cancellation policies or overbooking strategies can adversely affect a hotel's reputation and financial success. 

One possible use case includes Marriott International's recent changes in cancellation policy.
